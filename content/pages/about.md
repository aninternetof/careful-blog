# Hi, I'm Brady Hurlburt

I use this space to practice writing. I love playing music and mooching off friends who brew beer. I live in Indianapolis with my spouse and two pups.

I'm also a software engineer. I develop web services, and I'm a co-founder of [rovercode](https://rovercode.com), an educational robotics platform. I'm studying artificial intelligence at [Georgia Tech](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). If you're looking for business-card-type information, [here is that](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brady-hurlburt-9646b49a/).

You can get in touch with me by direct-messaging me [on Twitter]()https://twitter.com/aninternetof), or my leaving a comment on Disqus below.
