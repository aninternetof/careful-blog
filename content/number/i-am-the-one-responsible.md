It was today, but he hadn't remembered yet.

This bed had always been just ok. He liked sleeping over other places, or even making excuses to sleep other places in my apartment: the couch, a hammock on the porch. None of them are as good as his bed, but they are different, and he figured if there are always more different options, then there's the chance of a better one. *Excuses. To whom?* Besides, it's good when he wakes up several times in the night. It makes waking up in the morning just one more of those.

Mistake, accident, tragedy. The result felt the same.  Dropping and breaking the last glass they had saved from their wedding. Mistake, accident, tragedy. He'd probe today to see his how he saw it, but he wasn't thinking about that yet. So different, but the same panic. It's a tough problem to work out, so it's a wonder he fell asleep at all last night.

"Today is a new day". So much better would be yesterday again.

He remembered a few times when he had been so happy. Early. Cool sheets. Nothing was coming. Maybe it just needs to be cooler. Maybe a season change. Fall is coming. He remembered the most free day. In a hospital bed, everything can wait. *Accident? Mistake?*

The first thing he started to remember was yelling. It had been a couple of people, but it had really been him. *Why why why?* Mistake. So much better would be yesterday to do again. His boss would fire him today. Nearly more yelling, which is so laughable. Maybe panic is a bad teacher. It would be his new most free day. But he didn't know that. He was still in bed.









Today was the day after yesterday's massive tragedy. Or massive mistake. Which was it? There's a big difference, why can't he way which it was? The result is the same (she's gone), but

It was today, the day after the accident, but he hadn't remembered yet. The mistake? The tragedy? He hadn't decided by the time he feel asleep last night. It was a wonder he had fallen asleep at all. Today was the day he'd find out how his friend saw it. Accident, mistake, tragedy. But he didn't remember that yet.
