Tom Mitchell's [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html) has a cool definition of inductive bias.

<!--more-->

> [Inductive bias is] the set of assumptions B sufficient to deductively justify the inductive inference performed by the learner.

In other words, "If I could assume these things, I wouldn't need inductive reasoning -- I could deduce it."
